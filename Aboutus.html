    <!--Our Story-->
        <div class="aboutStory">
          <div class="aboutStoryContents">
            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Eleos Robotics had humble beginnings as a virtual company partly in France and Canada. The founding team had no savings or capital and they risked their finances and ended their careers to devote themselves to building Eleos Robotics. Many skeptics had insisted that we were attempting the impossible. However, all things are possible through God who strengthens us. What we lacked in finances and resources, we made up for with abundant grace, ingenuity, and intelligence.</p>

            <h2>What's Eleos Robotics</h2>
            <p>Eleos Robotics was built to be the platform on which numerous ingenious inventions will be created and one day impact the world. Although, we know that it's not technology that changes the world, it's the people behind the technology.</p>
            <h2>First Invention</h2>
            <p>
            Our first invention, Culture Bot, was inspired by the need for a technology that could remove pests on farms in a way that better reflects technological advancements and the changing values of society. The solution was made possible by cutting-edge advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence technology. It's common knowledge that pesticides are harmful to people and to the environment, but we hadn't realized how extremely expensive they were to use. Moreover, we found growers already have thin margins and the high costs of application burdens their operation. Organic growers, who take the ethical high road, have even higher costs.</p>
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>After witnessing decades of failed attempts at boycotting pesticides, we were convinced that a superior technology need to be invented and commercialized to make change happen. At Eleos Robotics, we believe that there is a better way of doing anything, so long as we make the effort. We care about the environment and most of all about people who depend on it.</p>
